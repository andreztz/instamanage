## instamanage

unfollow those who haven't followed you back. **no instagram api required**

this is a tool to unfollow those who haven't followed you back. it does it by pulling all the followers off the account and pulling all the following off the account and comparing the two. this data is saved in a `state.json` file so that the followers/following download does not have to be done each time.

### known limits
- 10 unfollows in 20 seconds results in a short period where you can't request anymore
